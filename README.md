# lispers
A slightly corroded LISP interpreter.

There are two things want in life, those are:
* to learn the rust programming language
* to write a LISP interpreter

So I did the obvious thing and started on an interpreter written in rust.

As of the initial commit I currently have bits and pieces all over the place, and there is already a 
really shitty REPL running in main, but it's only capable of telling if a value is an int, float or symbol at the moment.
I am also halfway in converting strings into linked lists, but I need to get a little bit more comfortable around the 
language before I really settle on an implementation there.
